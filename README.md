## Feature Engineering

- Feature Engineering involves transforming data into a format that makes it easier for algorithms to learn patterns.
  
- It can produce new features with the goal of simplifying and speeding up data transformations while also enhancing model accuracy. 

- Regardless of the data or architecture, a terrible feature will have a direct impact on your model.

## Importance of Feature Engineering

- Feature Engineering is a very important step in machine learning.

- Feature engineering refers to the process of designing artificial features into an algorithm.

- These artificial features are then used by that algorithm in order to improve its performance.
