## Feature Engineering

- Feature engineering is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new variables that aren’t in the training set.

- It can produce new features for both supervised and unsupervised learning, with the goal of simplifying and speeding up data transformations while also enhancing model accuracy. 

- Feature engineering is required when working with machine learning models. 

- Regardless of the data or architecture, a terrible feature will have a direct impact on your model.

## Importance of Feature Engineering

- Feature Engineering is a very important step in machine learning.

- Feature engineering refers to the process of designing artificial features into an algorithm.

- These artificial features are then used by that algorithm in order to improve its performance.
